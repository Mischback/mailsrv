# mailsrv

This is a mail server setup using [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/) as
**Mail Transport Agent** (MTA) and [Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/) as
**Mail Delivery Agent** (MDA).


## Disclaimer

This is my personal setup, which is based on *Christoph Haas'*
[ISPmail tutorial](https://workaround.org/bullseye/), though it deviates in
some aspects.

You may freely use the content of this repository (it's *MIT* licensed), but
be aware that you will have to adjust some aspects. I highly recommend working
through the [tutorial](https://workaround.org/bullseye/) to get a deeper
understanding of what is going on.
