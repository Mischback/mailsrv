# This is a **sample** of Postfix's ``virtual_domains`` file.
#
# It is not meant to be used directly, but will need automatic or manual
# adjustments to make it actually work.
#
# Provide the virtual domains for the mail setup
# These will be applied in Postfix's ``virtual_mailbox_domains`` setting.
#
# FORMAT: [key][BLANK][ANYTHING], where only [key] is relevant
#
# Example:
#
# Use *mailsrv.test* as a virtual domain and make Postfix accept mails for it.
#
#   mailsrv.test  OK
