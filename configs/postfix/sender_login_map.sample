# This is a **sample** of Postfix's ``sender_login_map`` file.
#
# It is not meant to be used directly, but will need automatic or manual
# adjustments to make it actually work.
#
# Provide the sender to login map for the mail setup.
# These will be applied in Postfix's ``smtpd_sender_login_maps`` setting.
#
# FIXME: With the current setup it is required to have entries for every
#        mailbox in this file.
#
#
# FORMAT: [key][BLANK][list of logins]
#
# Examples:
#
# This allows the owner of *mailbox01@mailsrv.test* to use *alias@mailsrv.test*
# as its *MAIL FROM* address.
#
#   alias@mailsrv.test  mailbox01@mailsrv.test
#
#
# This allows the owners of *mailbox01@mailsrv.test* and
# *mailbox02@mailsrv.test* to use *alias@mailsrv.test* as its *MAIL FROM*
# address.
#
#   alias@mailsrv.test  mailbox01@mailsrv.test mailbox02@mailsrv.test
