#
# Provide the sender to login map for the mail setup.
# These will be applied in Postfix's ``smtpd_sender_login_maps`` setting.
#
# In the current, file-based setup, it is required to have an entry for all
# mailboxes aswell. Most likely you will want to limit the sender-to-login
# mapping to the mailbox owner himself, e.g.
#
#   mailbox@mailsrv.test  mailbox@mailsrv.test
#
# This is an inconvenience right now, but given the low number of actual
# mailboxes, it is ok for now.
#
# https://github.com/Mischback/mailsrv/issues/16 is kind of related, as it will
# solve this inconvenience.

#
# FORMAT: [key][BLANK][list of logins]
#
# Examples:
#
# This allows the owner of *mailbox01@mailsrv.test* to use *alias@mailsrv.test*
# as its *MAIL FROM* address.
#
#   alias@mailsrv.test  mailbox01@mailsrv.test
#
#
# This allows the owners of *mailbox01@mailsrv.test* and
# *mailbox02@mailsrv.test* to use *alias@mailsrv.test* as its *MAIL FROM*
# address.
#
#   alias@mailsrv.test  mailbox01@mailsrv.test mailbox02@mailsrv.test
