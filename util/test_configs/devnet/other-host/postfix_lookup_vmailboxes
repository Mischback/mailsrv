# This is a **sample** of Postfix's ``virtual_mailboxes`` file.
#
# It is not meant to be used directly, but will need automatic or manual
# adjustments to make it actually work.
#
# Provide the virtual mailboxes for the mail setup
# These will be applied in Postfix's ``virtual_mailbox_maps`` setting. These
# are the actual mailboxes. The content of this file **should** be synchronized
# with Dovecot's user database. Otherwise the mailbox may not be accessed
# using Dovecot (IMAP or POP3) and the mailbox can not be used to send mails.
#
# FORMAT: [key][BLANK][ANYTHING], where only [key] is relevant
#
# Examples:
#
# Make *mailbox@mailsrv.test* an actual mailbox.
#
#   mailbox@mailsrv.test  OK
user@other-domain.test  OK
system@devnet.test      OK
