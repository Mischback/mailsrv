Welcome to mailsrv's documentation!
###################################

**mailsrv** is a *ready-to-deploy* setup to provide a personal mail service,
including `Postfix <https://www.postfix.org/>`_ as *Mail Transport Agent* (MTA)
and `Dovecot <https://www.dovecot.org/>`_ as *Mail Delivery Agent* (MDA).

The intended usage of **mailsrv** is an easy setup of a production-ready mail
setup, including **SMTP** (obviously), **IMAP** and **POP3** (to retrieve
mails).

.. note::
   **mailsrv** was created to implement my very own mail setup. It is easily
   deployable and customizable to personal needs.

**mailsrv** is developed and hosted
`@GitHub <https://github.com/Mischback/mailsrv>`_. Bugs and other issues may be
raised `there <https://github.com/Mischback/mailsrv/issues>`_.
