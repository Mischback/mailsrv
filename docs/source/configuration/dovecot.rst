Dovecot's Configuration
#######################

Dovecot's configuration is split into several files, kind of ordered by the
affected component or a functionality.

This is Dovecot's default way of configuration and as of now, there is no
reason to change anything about it. But it requires the administrator to adjust
configurations in several files. As **mailsrv** is all about easing this
configuration task, most of it should be achievable automatically.

.. important::
   The configuration files in :source:`configs/dovecot` include the actual
   settings aswell as documentation and references.

   They are not duplicated here, please see :issue:`38`.
