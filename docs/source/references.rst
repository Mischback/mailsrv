This page lists lots of references. Most of them were actually used while
implementing **mailsrv**, some were providing background information and others
included information that was tested but not included in the actual setup.

.. important::
   The primary and most notable source for the setup is *Christoph Haas'*
   `ISPmail guide for Debian "Bullseye" <https://workaround.org/bullseye/>`_.

   **mailsrv** does deviate in quite some aspects, but the tutorial is the very
   base. I'm standing on the shoulders of giants here.
